Dear sir,
	Thanks, to give me a chance to elaborate my skills.

	Before running the program install all dependencies.
	1. First, run scrap.py 
	2. Change the complete path of the saved CSV file, in 'views.py' a function name "scrap"
	 "/home/lovey/atul/django/hi5/templates/t.csv" to your new path of the file for Example  "c:\\desktop"
	3. Run the Django server
	4. Register your self and go on

		!!!Thank you!!!
